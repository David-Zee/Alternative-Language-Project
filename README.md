# Alternative-Language-Project-

For this project I used C# version 7.0.

I picked this language because of the .NET applications that run using the language and its overall convenience to understand in the field.

C# is an Object Oriented Programming language, allowing for the ease of creating classes and their respective methods. The language is very close to C and C++ syntactically, so the conditional statements, assignments, loops, function declaration, and exception handling are all very similar. File ingestion for the language is also very similar to the fashion of Java, using embedded classes and streamreaders to access file contents. For the unit testing I chose to make a simple menu that uses every function of the program.

System.Text.RegularExpressions is a library that handles regular expressions and their syntax. I used the library when parsing for certain values embedded in a string that all followed a structure I could model out.

System.Linq is a library that allows for the manipulation and querying of data from arrays and other sources. I used the library to find unique instances of OEMs to make it easier to count their average phone weights.

System.Collections.Generic is a library that provides a wide range of generic classes, interfaces, and methods to work with collection types. It has extension methods that work with Linq and therefore was a strong addition to the work load with collection types.

Answers:

What company (oem) has the highest average weight of the phone body?
